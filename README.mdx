# z-broadcast(/ˈzi bɹɔdˌkæst/ )

This hooks aims to be a thin wrapper around `BroadcastChannel` and provide type safety by using schema validation from zod.

There is no package to install as a dependency. Just steal the code from the `src` folder.

## Full example

Make a schema for the data you want to send and receive. Inferring the type from the schema is optional but recommended.

```js
const schema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
});

type Message = z.infer<typeof schema>;

const secondSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  age: z.number(),
});
```

and then use the hook like this

```js
const { data, postMessage } =
  useChannel <
  Message >
  {
    id: "new_test_channel",
    schema,
  };
```

## Channels

`const broadcastChannel = new BroadcastChannel(id);`

For two tabs to communicate, you need to create a channel with the same id.

It would be possible to mix up the data if it wasn't for the zod schema validation.
Invalid data results in data being set to undefined and the error property being set to a `ZodError`.

## postMessage

This validates the data against the provided schema before it's sent and synced to the state to stay in sync.

```js
const postMessage = (message: z.infer<typeof schema>) => {
  broadcastChannel.postMessage(message);
  const result = schema.safeParse(message);

  setData(result);
};
```

## Receiving data

The data is validated once more by the receiving tab

```js
broadcastChannel.onmessage = (event) => {
  const result = schema.safeParse(event.data);

  setData(result);
};
```
